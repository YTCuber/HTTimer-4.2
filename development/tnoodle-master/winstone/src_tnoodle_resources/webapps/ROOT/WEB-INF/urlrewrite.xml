    <rule>
        <note>
            The rule means that requests to /test/status/ will be redirected to /rewrite-status
            the url will be rewritten.
        </note>
        <from>/test/status/</from>
        <to type="redirect">%{context-path}/rewrite-status</to>
    </rule>


    <outbound-rule>
        <note>
            The outbound-rule specifies that when response.encodeURL is called (if you are using JSTL c:url)
            the url /rewrite-status will be rewritten to /test/status/.

            The above rule and this outbound-rule means that end users should never see the
            url /rewrite-status only /test/status/ both in their location bar and in hyperlinks
            in your pages.
        </note>
        <from>/rewrite-status</from>
        <to>/test/status/</to>
    </outbound-rule>
