### Fixed
+seeding scrambles doesn't work
+format scramble source better
+importing scrambles window doesn't fit
+scramble shouldn't be on top of fullscreen or importing scrambles windows
+import scramble window is on top of fullscreen timer
+scramble automove doesn't save location
        +apply more often than just resizing the window?
+scramble autosizing causes a bit of lag on the timer...
+table should force its resizing up to the layout manager
+tapping space right after stopping timer turns green & 0.00, even though the timer can't run yet
+formatting +2 penalties doesn't work
        +saving DNF/+2 doesn't seem to work...
+switching session with imported scrambles would ask if you wanted to clear the imported scrambles
+make times columns hideable, consolidate that code, add tooltips
        +getValueCenties -> just centis...
+don't let the scramble grow too large!
+TimesTable
        +addtime grows the add time row
        +weird stuff happens with extremely large times
        +hovering to penalize/tag times...
+1 line scrambles shouldn't get oddly spaced
+cannot call split of undefined when getting scramble & server is down
+sizing of table columns option is odd in chrome, fixed with nasty workaround
+selecting multiple times shows X on all times
+tagging div doesn't disappear in FF
+best session ave is colored, what's the point?
        +same goes for some of the other columns
+fix file permissions
+tagging doesn't default correctly
+!!!comments aren't being positioned nicely in chrome on os X
+Xbrowser stuff
        +keyDown only gets called once on ff, makes sense
        +select dropdown styling...
    +scramble doesn't wrap on opera
    +opera keyboard shortcuts are iffy, fixed as best as possible
        +apparently opera binds all sorts of crap, like ctrl+z, ctrl+y, but they're blocked when in a text field. This means that a user can configure ctrl+z as a shortcut, but when they try to use it, they won't be focused on a text box, so opera goes and does its thing. Maybe there's a solution here that involves focusing the user on an invisible text box and listening to events there, lol
+added medians
+configurable columns
        +add gui for this!
+ +/- looks like an underlined plus sign. Buttons? Like the AA buttons in rich text editors?
        +scratch that idea, instead, automatically make the scramble fit
+load scramble once timer has started to reduce lag
+"3x3 session started..." should become a dropdown box, remove old box
+esc to get rid of import scrambles window
+undo redo
        +maintain scramble list! urghhhh
+add space between table and scrambles (leyan)
+auto scroll should show the add time row!
+save scramble view state on a per customization basis
+0.00 when keys down now reflects the update frequency
+wca style penalties
+get consensus on what the hell a session average is!
        +add new session average!
        +stdev is the standard deviation of times, not session averages
+big scramble view is blurry (pedro)
+fixed bug where resizing scramble image could make it permanently too big
+improve behavior of update freq option
+need a favicon.ico!
+always manual time entry a la qqtimer
+scramble position not being saved
+build script should read version from other build script?
+solve/session comments
        +session comments & probably solve comments not being saved
        +session comments -> tab name?
        +need the exact dates of sessions somewhere
+times table needs to gracefully scale down to 1 column, else there's no point in making the columns configurable
        +vertically align penalty labels with radio buttons
        +error message when adding time can get in the way
        +icons for "Reset" and "Download" links
+twitter style hashtags in comments
+ensure that times table is wide enough for all 3 selects
+sq1 scramble spacing: only pad if it can be done in <= 3 spaces
+show some details on the currently selected solve?
        +how about an "import scramble" link?
+holding down space and then tapping "n" gives odd behavior - fixed
+pgup pgdown should scroll the times table
+BOLD for "Edit" and "New session"
+ =) ***** SYSTEM TO CHANGE PUZZLE/EVENT OF CURRENT SESSION *****

        +customizable =)

        +documentation & configuration
        +configure by pressing?
        +avoid duplicates as best as possible

+holding down spacebar while focusing comment area is bad
+holding down spacebar w/ defocusing tnt will result in the timer starting upon refocusing
+puzzle icons!
        +gracefully degrade for plugins with no icon
        +find a place to use the icons...custom <select> with support for icons
+add a "new session" icon
+shortcuts menu on gerty doesn't work
+configurable length wca style inspection? apparently some people use this
+build problems
        +A uses B, A & B are built, B changes (A doesn't), now we compile A and nothing happens (silly optimization of the ant java task)!
        +FIX MINIFICATION (by reverting to old jslint, lol)
        +optimize git commit hook to only jslint when a .js file has been modified
        +sometimes index.html,tnt.js,tnt.css get clobbered by ant build =(
        +ant, ant -> the second call does nothing! =)
        +get rid of Main-Class from jars that don't need them
        +uncompiled jcubeexplorer doesn't work, tables don't get saved?

+thread safety! this must be done before giving to the WCA
+fmc generation
+cleanup readme.textile & root html (just add name, lol)
+Tac style error catching + pdb
+save twophase tables to file & load on startup
+ensure twophase code is both thread safe and thread fast, perhaps keep a ThreadLocal<Search> inside of CubeScrambler?
+importing a tnt scramble DOES NOT freaking work!, reimporting scramble with a lot of spaces...?
+keyboard shortcuts now say keys(c) when configured? this must have changed with the new mootools
+pressing r to reset is causing the reset dialog to pop up repeatedly
+storing DNFs doesn't work! darn JSON doesn't like Infinity times
+pdf page #
+nuke build.xml files
+VERSIONING/RELEASE CYCLE

+right click doesn't work inside of stats field
+adjusting brightness rapidly starts and stops the timer
        +opening laptop lid also starts the timer
+ctrl+a/select all doesn't work inside of stats field
+holding down keys w/ inspection on shows 0.00, which doesn't really make sense
+clicking to view the RA of an already selected time makes it editable
+reset timer shortcut
+true fullscreen?
        -esc-ing out of fullscreen in firefox screws up timer font
        +leaving fullscreen screws up the scrolling of the times table
+pressing escape right after loading TNT causes an exception
+pressing escape to close a dialog causes the reset shortcut to fire
+pressing esc while commenting on a session doesn't stop propagation of the event
+clicking on ave100 does something even when there is no ave100
+add time "dnf" -> cannot call savesessions of
+replace all issue with time stats?
+esc doesn't close time comment
+resetting format str doesn't seem to work
+shift/ctrl select times starts timer on windows because ctrl and shift keyrepeat
+tmt.createPopup hide() should give the timer focus
+clean up font stuff, there's no need to distribute the fontforge file...
